Another drama is going on. you go back to the box and check if the key [[opens the box]].</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="47" name="new key" tags="" position="4200,2400" size="100,100">You grab the new key, close the box and put it the same way that it was. 
This one is a door&#39;s key. 
You go to the hallway and check the storage room. Yes, it is working. The shouting and screaming is still going on but you don&#39;t care anymore. 
you step inside the room which is full of ...
Your grandmother is calling you to go downstair. 
You answer: &quot;coming&quot; but go to [[storage room]] or &quot;coming&quot; and really go to [[downstairs]].</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="48" name="downstairs" tags="" position="4500,1900" size="100,100">Your grandmother stays by the windows and while you check the living room, you see a small album under newspapers. 
It&#39;s a small album with an old cover that its colors has faded away. There is a persian word on the cover but you don&#39;t know anything in this language. Your groundmother still checking the yard and the neighbour. She doesn&#39;t notice that you saw the album. 
You ask your grandmother [[about the album]] or go [[check the neighbour]] .</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="49" name="storage room" tags="" position="4600,2300" size="100,100">The storage room is full of boxes and clothes. They are all old-fashion. There is box of children clothes. Another one is full of old toys. They must be related to your father then why your grandmother stored all old stuff here. 
you see an old treasure box similar to the one that was under bed. 
This one is unlocked. You open it and see some documents and old pictures. You were right, these stuff are related to your father&#39;s childhood.
There are two small size picture of your father when he was just a child. one year or maybe less.
There is an envelope inside the box that it is not new. as if it is closed years ago and the glue is not attaching anyting together. 
You decide to [[open the envelope|envelope]] or [[check other pictures|otherPics]].</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="50" name="break the box" tags="" position="4900,1800" size="100,100">You check all the places but nothing that you can break the box with. Damn it! you have to go back [[downstairs]] and grab the key. &quot;What might be inside the room?&quot;</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="51" name="otherPics" tags="" position="4800,2500" size="100,100">There are other pictures in the box. You can recognize some of people in the picture. Grandmother, father, mother and you at very young age. Maybe 6 months.  There is another picture a woman who is expecting a baby, smiling while leaning on the table in the kitchen. You have no idea, who she is. Then another picture of the woman and a man. Who they are, you don&#39;t know. 
Maybe envolope can tell you who they are. 
You open the [[envelope]].
You</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="52" name="envelope" tags="" position="4800,2200" size="100,100">It&#39;s a small envelope. You bring the paper out of the envelop, thinking what might be inside? Is it related to your father? Is your grandmother dying?
You open the letter and start reading it. The more you read the more you are suprised, thinking it is a story or a real letter?
Why no one talked about it? You are so confused and feel that you are out of breath.
You decide to go downstairs and [[ask your grandmother]] about what is inside the letter or leave the house. You [[can&#39;t talk]] about it. you need a fresh air.</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="53" name="ask your grandmother" tags="" position="5000,2400" size="100,100">&quot;What this letter says?&quot; that&#39;s you asking from your grandmother while standing on stairs. She takes her attention from back yard and neighbour, sees you with tears on your face, then sees pictures and letters on your hand:&quot; Oh my...How id you get there honey? You... are not supposed to...&quot; 
You become angry:&quot; I&#39;m not supposed to know that I&#39;m not your grandchild..or my father&#39;s child... or not born in this country after all.&quot; 
Her eyes are tearful but you don&#39;t care. So much infrmation that you can&#39;t bear it. She is coming for you to hug. You give her a hug, and burst to tears why you did this to me. 
&quot;Honey, I&#39;m sorry. we want to tell you soon but there wasn&#39;t a right time to tell you adopted.&quot; 
Please sit here. I&#39;ll bring you tea and we can talk about.
The old house is like a cage that becomes smaller and smaller.
You [[can&#39;t stay]] or decide [[to stay]] and talk about it.</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="54" name="can&#39;t talk" tags="envelope" position="5000,2200" size="100,100">You are on tears. You grab all is inside the box and go downstairs to get the backpack.
Your grandmother notices.&quot; where are you going, honey?&quot; 
You stop for a moment and want to tell her that you know everything but you can&#39;t breathe. 
 You say:&quot;I [[can&#39;t stay]] and go out of the house.</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="55" name="can&#39;t stay" tags="End" position="5300,2300" size="100,100">You run away from home and put your phone on silent because your grandmother is calling you over and over.  
-End-</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="56" name="to stay" tags="End" position="5200,2600" size="100,100">The neighbour seems quiet now. You sit on the sofa, feeling confused. Who you are. Your grandmother comes over with two cup of tea. 
Then she starts to tell the story. The woman and the man in the pictures are your biological  parents. Grandmother went to her home country, visiting the family. Then the big earthquack in the winter. She went there to help as a volunteer and found your mother there. She is crying while remembering those days. These two pictures were all she had from home and family. She lost everyone there including your biological father in the earthquack and she passed away two days after your birth. 
You feel devastated:&quot; why you bring me here then, You could leave me there.&quot; 
&quot;Honey you know that I love you. Your mother asked me to take care of you.&quot; she says.
&quot;My son and daughter-in-law couldn&#39;t have a baby and I thought... we thought...we all could take care of you&quot; she continues.
You have nothing to say.  You are in tears and give her a hug.
